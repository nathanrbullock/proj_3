    <h1>Benefits of regular physical activity</h1>
<br>
<br>
    <p>You know exercise is good for you, but do you know how good? From boosting your mood to improving your sex life, find out how exercise can improve your life.
<br>
<br>
    The health benefits of regular exercise and physical activity are hard to ignore. Everyone benefits from exercise, regardless of age, sex or physical ability.
<br>
<br>
    Need more convincing to get moving? Check out these seven ways exercise can lead to a happier, healthier you.
<br>
<br>
    1. Exercise controls weight
    Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
<br>
    Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day â€” take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.
<br>
<br>
    2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases
    Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No matter what your current weight, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol and decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
<br>
    Regular exercise helps prevent or manage a wide range of health problems and concerns, including stroke, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, depression, a number of types of cancer, arthritis and falls.
<br>
<br>
    3. Exercise improves mood
    Need an emotional lift? Or need to blow off some steam after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk 30-minute walk can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier and more relaxed.
<br>
    You may also feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.
<br>
<br>
    4. Exercise boosts energy
    Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
<br>
<br>
    Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.</p>
